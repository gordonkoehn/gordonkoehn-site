# Photos from Stratosphere

## Kickstarter Funded Weather-balloon photography from 38.5 km above sea level

*This project was an independent venture in 2017.*

In early summer of 2016, I got together with another friend, **[Jonas E. Petersen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jep7/)**, to launch a weather balloon to reach as near to space as we could to satisfy the inner child's dream of space travel. After nearly a year and one failed launch, we reached 38 km above sea level and successfully took pictures, showing Earth's curvature. The project was heavily overfunded in two Kickstarter campaigns with supporters from all around the globe.

As the first launch failed we had to raise more money, and it worked. We got so much more that we went much higher than planned:

**[Initial Kickstarter Project - 52 Supporters gave 1434 €.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gordonkoehn/caelum-photos-from-stratosphere/community)**

**[2nd Kickstarter Project - 35 Supporters gave 979 €.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gordonkoehn/caelum-photos-from-stratosphere-2nd-launch-2nd-fun/description)**
