## **Android Casual Game: Linearity**
## *Development of a monetized mobile game in a team of 5*
Working Period: 2015-2016

### **Overview**
NyxX Studios was a team of developers which was founded in February 2015. We were five students from Hamburg (Germany) who were interested in modelling and programming. We started our first project called 'Linearity'. It's a simple casual game. The game was published in Play Store with monetization via advertisement.

Unfortunately, it has been taken down in 2019 as new Play Store regulations came into action.

The legacy webpage can still be found here: **[NyxX Studios Legacy Page](/assets/blog/linearity/legacy/index.html)**
