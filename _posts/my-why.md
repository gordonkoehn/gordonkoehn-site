Hey – I'm Gordon. 

**The world is exciting. Understanding its workings is my motivation. I'm a techno optimist – eager to expand human reach and capabilities with technology.**

**That's why I choose to solve hard problems. I want to answer questions about the physical world: The world of atoms.**

**I build computer and data-intensive oracles to answer questions.**

I enjoy falling forward. 

Looking forward to a life of solving high-stakes problems in space-, bio-, energy-, and also defense tech.

## Currently

### Day
Building for Switzerland Viral Surveillance. I am developing the data importer for a next-generation genomic database, to speed up the discovery of new viral variants in Swiss wastewaters.

### Night
Learning long-tail DEX market making. Excited to understand market mechanics, which will underpin Web3. Actively building on SUI, preparing for the dawn of Web3.
